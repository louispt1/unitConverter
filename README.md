# README

Ruby version: 3.3.0

This was my first Ruby web app, and more or less the first time I coded anything in Ruby. I put a little bit of HTML in there just to make it look nice and to simplify handling queries. I did not include any tests in this version because I have no experience writing tests for this kind of code, or in Ruby.

**Deployment:**
  - The app is not deployed or hosted, so you can only run it locally for now.
  - Fork the repo, run the rails server (`rails s`) and then the application should run, usually on your default 127.0.0.1 network address.
  - The application should work intuitively.
