Ruby 3.3.0
Rails 7.1.3.2

This was my first Ruby web app, and more or less the first time I have coded anything in Ruby. I put a little bit of HTML in there just to make it look nice. I did not include any tests in this version because I have no experience writing tests for this kind of code, or in Ruby.

**Deployment:**
  - The app is not deployed or hosted, so you can only run it locally for now.
  - Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/louispt1/unitConverter.git`
  - In the directory, `bundle install`, then `rake db:migrate` (not strictly necessary at this stage).
  - Then run the rails server `rails s`.
